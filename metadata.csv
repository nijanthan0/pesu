arctic_a0001|default|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
arctic_a0002|default|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
arctic_a0003|default|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.,,
arctic_a0004|default|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
arctic_a0005|default|Will we ever forget it.,,
arctic_a0006|default|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.,
arctic_a0007|default|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.,,
arctic_a0008|default|Gad, your letter came just in time.,
arctic_a0009|default|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.,
arctic_a0010|default|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.,,
arctic_a0011|default|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.,,
arctic_a0012|default|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.,,
arctic_a0013|default|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.,
arctic_a0014|default|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
arctic_a0015|default|It's the aurora borealis.,,
arctic_a0016|default|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
arctic_a0017|default|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.,,
arctic_a0018|default|There was a change now.,,
arctic_a0019|default|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.,
arctic_a0020|default|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.,,
arctic_a0021|default|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.,,
arctic_a0022|default|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.,,
arctic_a0023|default|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.,,
arctic_a0024|default|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.,,
arctic_a0025|default|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.,,
arctic_a0026|default|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.,,
arctic_a0027|default|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.,,
arctic_a0028|default|Robbery, bribery, fraud
arctic_a0029|default|Their forces were already moving into the north country.,,
arctic_a0030|default|I had faith in them.,,
arctic_a0031|default|They were three hundred yards apart.,,
arctic_a0032|default|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.,,
arctic_a0033|default|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.,
arctic_a0034|default|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.,,
arctic_a0035|default|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.,
arctic_a0036|default|She turned in at the hotel.,,
arctic_a0037|default|I was the only one who remained sitting.,,
arctic_a0038|default|We'll have to watch our chances.,,
arctic_a0039|default|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.,,
arctic_a0040|default|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.,,
arctic_a0041|default|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.,,
arctic_a0042|default|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.,,
arctic_a0043|default|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.,,
arctic_a0044|default|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.,,
arctic_a0045|default|He moved away as quietly as he had come.,,
arctic_a0046|default|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.,
arctic_a0047|default|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.,,
arctic_a0048|default|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.,
arctic_a0049|default|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.,,
arctic_a0050|default|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.,,
arctic_a0051|default|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.,
arctic_a0052|default|It was a curious coincidence.,,
arctic_a0053|default|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.,,
arctic_a0054|default|There was nothing on the rock.,,
arctic_a0055|default|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.,
arctic_a0056|default|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.,,
arctic_a0057|default|I have no idea, replied Philip.,
arctic_a0058|default|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.,,
arctic_a0059|default|His immaculate appearance was gone.,,
arctic_a0060|default|Anyway, no one saw her like that.,
arctic_a0061|default|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.,,
arctic_a0062|default|The men stared into each other's face.,,
arctic_a0063|default|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
arctic_a0064|default|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.,,
arctic_a0065|default|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.,,
arctic_a0066|default|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.,,
arctic_a0067|default|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.,
arctic_a0068|default|In a flash Philip followed its direction.,,
arctic_a0069|default|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.,,
arctic_a0070|default|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.,,
arctic_a0071|default|What was the object of your little sensation.,,
arctic_a0072|default|But who was Eileen's double.,,
arctic_a0073|default|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.,
arctic_a0074|default|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
arctic_a0075|default|There has been a change, she interrupted him.,
arctic_a0076|default|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.,,
arctic_a0077|default|It is the fire, partly, she said.
arctic_a0078|default|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
arctic_a0079|default|It was a large canoe.,,
arctic_a0080|default|What if Jeanne failed him.,,
arctic_a0081|default|What if she did not come to the rock.,,
arctic_a0082|default|His face was streaming with blood.,,
arctic_a0083|default|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.,,
arctic_a0084|default|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.,,
arctic_a0085|default|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.,,
arctic_a0086|default|Death had come with terrible suddenness.,,
arctic_a0087|default|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.,
arctic_a0088|default|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.,
arctic_a0089|default|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.,,
arctic_a0090|default|The singing voice approached rapidly.,,
arctic_a0091|default|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.,,
arctic_a0092|default|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.,
arctic_a0093|default|For a full minute he crouched and listened.,,
arctic_a0094|default|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.,,
arctic_a0095|default|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.,,
arctic_a0096|default|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.,,
arctic_a0097|default|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.,,
arctic_a0098|default|Shall I carry you.,,
arctic_a0099|default|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.,,
arctic_a0100|default|You must sleep, he urged.,
arctic_a0101|default|You, you would not keep the truth from me.,
arctic_a0102|default|He will follow us soon.,,
arctic_a0103|default|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.,,
arctic_a0104|default|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.,,
arctic_a0105|default|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
arctic_a0106|default|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.,,
arctic_a0107|default|If you only could know how I thank you.,,
arctic_a0108|default|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.,,
arctic_a0110|default|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
arctic_a0111|default|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.,
arctic_a0112|default|He was wounded in the arm.,,
arctic_a0113|default|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.,,
arctic_a0114|default|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.,,
arctic_a0115|default|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.,,
arctic_a0116|default|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.,,
arctic_a0117|default|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.,
arctic_a0118|default|Pierre obeys me when we are together.,,
arctic_a0119|default|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.,,
arctic_a0120|default|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.,,
arctic_a0121|default|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.,
arctic_a0122|default|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.,,
arctic_a0123|default|She had died from cold and starvation.,,
arctic_a0124|default|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.,,
arctic_a0125|default|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.,,
arctic_a0126|default|Each day she became a more vital part of him.,,
arctic_a0127|default|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.,
arctic_a0128|default|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.,,
arctic_a0129|default|Her face was against his breast.,,
arctic_a0130|default|She was his now, forever.,
arctic_a0131|default|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.,,
arctic_a0132|default|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.,,
arctic_a0133|default|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.,,
arctic_a0134|default|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.,,
arctic_a0135|default|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.,
arctic_a0136|default|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
arctic_a0137|default|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.,,
arctic_a0138|default|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.,,
arctic_a0139|default|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.,,
arctic_a0140|default|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
arctic_a0141|default|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.,,
arctic_a0142|default|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.,
arctic_a0143|default|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
arctic_a0144|default|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.,,
arctic_a0145|default|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.,
arctic_a0146|default|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
arctic_a0147|default|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.,,
arctic_a0148|default|Now these things had been struck dead within him.,,
arctic_a0149|default|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.,,
arctic_a0150|default|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
