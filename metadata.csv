arctic_a0001|default|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.,
arctic_a0002|default|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.,
arctic_a0003|default|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.,,,
arctic_a0004|default|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.,
arctic_a0005|default|Will we ever forget it.,,,
arctic_a0006|default|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.,,
arctic_a0007|default|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.,,,
arctic_a0008|default|Gad, your letter came just in time.,,
arctic_a0009|default|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.,,
arctic_a0010|default|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.,,,
arctic_a0011|default|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.,,,
arctic_a0012|default|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.,,,
arctic_a0013|default|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.,,
arctic_a0014|default|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.,
arctic_a0015|default|It's the aurora borealis.,,,
arctic_a0016|default|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.,
arctic_a0017|default|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.,,,
arctic_a0018|default|There was a change now.,,,
arctic_a0019|default|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.,,
arctic_a0020|default|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.,,,
arctic_a0021|default|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.,,,
arctic_a0022|default|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.,,,
arctic_a0023|default|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.,,,
arctic_a0024|default|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.,,,
arctic_a0025|default|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.,,,
arctic_a0026|default|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.,,,
arctic_a0027|default|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.,,,
arctic_a0028|default|Robbery, bribery, fraud,
arctic_a0029|default|Their forces were already moving into the north country.,,,
arctic_a0030|default|I had faith in them.,,,
arctic_a0031|default|They were three hundred yards apart.,,,
arctic_a0032|default|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.,,,
arctic_a0033|default|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.,,
arctic_a0034|default|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.,,,
arctic_a0035|default|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.,,
arctic_a0036|default|She turned in at the hotel.,,,
arctic_a0037|default|I was the only one who remained sitting.,,,
arctic_a0038|default|We'll have to watch our chances.,,,
arctic_a0039|default|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.,,,
arctic_a0040|default|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.,,,
arctic_a0041|default|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.,,,
arctic_a0042|default|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.,,,
arctic_a0043|default|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.,,,
arctic_a0044|default|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.,,,
arctic_a0045|default|He moved away as quietly as he had come.,,,
arctic_a0046|default|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.,,
arctic_a0047|default|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.,,,
arctic_a0048|default|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.,,
arctic_a0049|default|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.,,,
arctic_a0050|default|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.,,,
arctic_a0051|default|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.,,
arctic_a0052|default|It was a curious coincidence.,,,
arctic_a0053|default|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.,,,
arctic_a0054|default|There was nothing on the rock.,,,
arctic_a0055|default|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.,,
arctic_a0056|default|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.,,,
arctic_a0057|default|I have no idea, replied Philip.,,
arctic_a0058|default|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.,,,
arctic_a0059|default|His immaculate appearance was gone.,,,
arctic_a0060|default|Anyway, no one saw her like that.,,
arctic_a0061|default|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.,,,
arctic_a0062|default|The men stared into each other's face.,,,
arctic_a0063|default|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.,
arctic_a0064|default|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.,,,
arctic_a0065|default|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.,,,
arctic_a0066|default|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.,,,
arctic_a0067|default|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.,,
arctic_a0068|default|In a flash Philip followed its direction.,,,
arctic_a0069|default|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.,,,
arctic_a0070|default|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.,,,
arctic_a0071|default|What was the object of your little sensation.,,,
arctic_a0072|default|But who was Eileen's double.,,,
arctic_a0073|default|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.,,
arctic_a0074|default|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.,
arctic_a0075|default|There has been a change, she interrupted him.,,
arctic_a0076|default|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.,,,
arctic_a0077|default|It is the fire, partly, she said.,
arctic_a0078|default|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.,
arctic_a0079|default|It was a large canoe.,,,
arctic_a0080|default|What if Jeanne failed him.,,,
arctic_a0081|default|What if she did not come to the rock.,,,
arctic_a0082|default|His face was streaming with blood.,,,
arctic_a0083|default|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.,,,
arctic_a0084|default|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.,,,
arctic_a0085|default|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.,,,
arctic_a0086|default|Death had come with terrible suddenness.,,,
arctic_a0087|default|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.,,
arctic_a0088|default|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.,,
arctic_a0089|default|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.,,,
arctic_a0090|default|The singing voice approached rapidly.,,,
arctic_a0091|default|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.,,,
arctic_a0092|default|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.,,
arctic_a0093|default|For a full minute he crouched and listened.,,,
arctic_a0094|default|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.,,,
arctic_a0095|default|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.,,,
arctic_a0096|default|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.,,,
arctic_a0097|default|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.,,,
arctic_a0098|default|Shall I carry you.,,,
arctic_a0099|default|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.,,,
arctic_a0100|default|You must sleep, he urged.,,
arctic_a0101|default|You, you would not keep the truth from me.,,
arctic_a0102|default|He will follow us soon.,,,
arctic_a0103|default|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.,,,
arctic_a0104|default|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.,,,
arctic_a0105|default|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.,
arctic_a0106|default|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.,,,
arctic_a0107|default|If you only could know how I thank you.,,,
arctic_a0108|default|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.,,,
arctic_a0110|default|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.,
arctic_a0111|default|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.,,
arctic_a0112|default|He was wounded in the arm.,,,
arctic_a0113|default|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.,,,
arctic_a0114|default|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.,,,
arctic_a0115|default|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.,,,
arctic_a0116|default|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.,,,
arctic_a0117|default|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.,,
arctic_a0118|default|Pierre obeys me when we are together.,,,
arctic_a0119|default|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.,,,
arctic_a0120|default|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.,,,
arctic_a0121|default|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.,,
arctic_a0122|default|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.,,,
arctic_a0123|default|She had died from cold and starvation.,,,
arctic_a0124|default|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.,,,
arctic_a0125|default|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.,,,
arctic_a0126|default|Each day she became a more vital part of him.,,,
arctic_a0127|default|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.,,
arctic_a0128|default|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.,,,
arctic_a0129|default|Her face was against his breast.,,,
arctic_a0130|default|She was his now, forever.,,
arctic_a0131|default|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.,,,
arctic_a0132|default|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.,,,
arctic_a0133|default|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.,,,
arctic_a0134|default|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.,,,
arctic_a0135|default|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.,,
arctic_a0136|default|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.,
arctic_a0137|default|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.,,,
arctic_a0138|default|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.,,,
arctic_a0139|default|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.,,,
arctic_a0140|default|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.,
arctic_a0141|default|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.,,,
arctic_a0142|default|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.,,
arctic_a0143|default|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.,
arctic_a0144|default|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.,,,
arctic_a0145|default|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.,,
arctic_a0146|default|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.,
arctic_a0147|default|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.,,,
arctic_a0148|default|Now these things had been struck dead within him.,,,
arctic_a0149|default|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.,,,
arctic_a0150|default|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.,
arctic_a0151|default|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.,,
arctic_a0152|default|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.,,,
arctic_a0153|default|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.,,,
arctic_a0154|default|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.,,
arctic_a0155|default|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.,,
arctic_a0156|default|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.,,,
arctic_a0157|default|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.,,
arctic_a0158|default|Does that look good.,,,
arctic_a0159|default|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.,,,
arctic_a0160|default|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.,,,
arctic_a0161|default|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.,,,
arctic_a0162|default|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.,,
arctic_a0163|default|Philip made no effort to follow.,,,
arctic_a0164|default|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.,,
arctic_a0165|default|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.,,,
arctic_a0166|default|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.,,,
arctic_a0167|default|I was near the cabin, and saw you.,,
arctic_a0168|default|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.,,,
arctic_a0169|default|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.,,,
arctic_a0170|default|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.,,,
arctic_a0171|default|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.,,
arctic_a0172|default|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.,,,
arctic_a0173|default|The date was nearly eighteen years old.,,,
arctic_a0174|default|They were the presage of storm.,,,
arctic_a0175|default|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.,,,
arctic_a0176|default|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.,,,
arctic_a0177|default|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.,,,
arctic_a0178|default|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.,,,
arctic_a0179|default|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.,,
arctic_a0180|default|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.,,
arctic_a0181|default|So cheer up, and give us your paw.,,
arctic_a0182|default|This time he did not yap for mercy.,,,
arctic_a0183|default|And the air was growing chilly.,,,
arctic_a0184|default|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.,,
arctic_a0185|default|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.,,,
arctic_a0186|default|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.,,,
arctic_a0187|default|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.,,,
arctic_a0188|default|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.,,,
arctic_a0189|default|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.,,
arctic_a0190|default|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.,,,
arctic_a0191|default|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.,,,
arctic_a0192|default|He did not rush in.,,,
arctic_a0193|default|It was edged with ice.,,,
arctic_a0194|default|He drank of the water cautiously.,,,
arctic_a0195|default|But a strange thing happened.,,,
arctic_a0196|default|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.,,,
arctic_a0197|default|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.,,
arctic_a0198|default|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.,,,
arctic_a0199|default|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.,,,
arctic_a0200|default|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.,,
arctic_a0201|default|He cried, and swung the club wildly.,,
arctic_a0202|default|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.,,
arctic_a0203|default|They were following the shore of a lake.,,,
arctic_a0204|default|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.,,,
arctic_a0205|default|From now on we're pals.,,,
arctic_a0206|default|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.,,,
arctic_a0207|default|How much was it.,,,
arctic_a0208|default|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.,,
arctic_a0209|default|It was not a large lake, and almost round.,,
arctic_a0210|default|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.,,,
arctic_a0211|default|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.,,,
arctic_a0212|default|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.,
arctic_a0213|default|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.,,,
arctic_a0214|default|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.,,
arctic_a0215|default|They die out of spite.,,,
arctic_a0216|default|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.,,,
arctic_a0217|default|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.,,
arctic_a0218|default|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.,,,
arctic_a0219|default|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.,,,
arctic_a0220|default|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.,,,
arctic_a0221|default|I don't know why you're here at all.,,,
arctic_a0222|default|What part of the United States is your home.,,,
arctic_a0223|default|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.,,
arctic_a0224|default|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.,,
arctic_a0225|default|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.,,,
arctic_a0226|default|That came before my A B C's.,,,
arctic_a0227|default|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.,,,
arctic_a0228|default|But it contributed to the smash.,,,
arctic_a0229|default|The last one I knew was an overseer.,,,
arctic_a0230|default|Do you know any good land around here.,,,
arctic_a0231|default|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.,,,
arctic_a0232|default|I cannot follow you, she said.,,
arctic_a0233|default|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.,,,
arctic_a0234|default|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.,,
arctic_a0235|default|His voice was passionately rebellious.,,,
arctic_a0236|default|Don't you see I hate you.,,,
arctic_a0237|default|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.,,,
arctic_a0238|default|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.,,,
arctic_a0239|default|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.,,,
arctic_a0240|default|Wash your hands of me.,,,
arctic_a0241|default|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.,,,
arctic_a0242|default|I saw it when she rolled.,,,
arctic_a0243|default|I only read the quotations.,,,
arctic_a0244|default|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.,,,
arctic_a0245|default|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.,,
arctic_a0246|default|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.,,,
arctic_a0247|default|They ought to pass here some time today.,,,
arctic_a0248|default|I had been sad too long already.,,,
arctic_a0249|default|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.,
arctic_a0250|default|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.,,,
arctic_a0251|default|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.,,,
arctic_a0252|default|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.,,,
arctic_a0253|default|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.,,,
arctic_a0254|default|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.,,
arctic_a0255|default|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.,,
arctic_a0256|default|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.,,,
arctic_a0257|default|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.,,
arctic_a0258|default|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.,,,
arctic_a0259|default|Think of investing in such an adventure.,,,
arctic_a0260|default|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.,,
arctic_a0261|default|I have been doubly baptized.,,,
arctic_a0262|default|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.,,,
arctic_a0263|default|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.,,
arctic_a0264|default|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.,,
arctic_a0265|default|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.,,,
arctic_a0266|default|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.,,
arctic_a0267|default|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.,,
arctic_a0268|default|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.,,,
arctic_a0269|default|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.,,,
arctic_a0270|default|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.,,,
arctic_a0271|default|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.,,,
arctic_a0272|default|You can take a vacation on pay.,,,
arctic_a0273|default|They are big trees and require plenty of room.,,,
arctic_a0274|default|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.,,,
arctic_a0275|default|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.,,,
arctic_a0276|default|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.,,,
arctic_a0277|default|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.,,
arctic_a0278|default|It would give me nervous prostration.,,,
arctic_a0279|default|She said with chattering teeth.,,,
arctic_a0280|default|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.,,,
arctic_a0281|default|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.,,,
arctic_a0282|default|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.,,,
arctic_a0283|default|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.,
arctic_a0284|default|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.,,,
arctic_a0285|default|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.,,,
arctic_a0286|default|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.,,,
arctic_a0287|default|Keep an eye on him.,,,
arctic_a0288|default|Those are my oysters, he said at last.,,
arctic_a0289|default|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.,,
arctic_a0290|default|One by one the boys were captured.,,,
arctic_a0291|default|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.,,
arctic_a0292|default|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.,
arctic_a0293|default|They were deep in the primeval forest.,,,
arctic_a0294|default|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.,,,
arctic_a0295|default|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.,,,
arctic_a0296|default|Bassett was a fastidious man.,,,
arctic_a0297|default|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.,,,
arctic_a0298|default|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.,,,
arctic_a0299|default|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.,,,
arctic_a0300|default|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.,,,
arctic_a0301|default|But all my dreams violated this law.,,,
arctic_a0302|default|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.,,
arctic_a0303|default|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.,,,
arctic_a0304|default|I graduated last of my class.,,,
arctic_a0305|default|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.,,
arctic_a0306|default|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.,,,
arctic_a0307|default|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.,,
arctic_a0308|default|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.,,,
arctic_a0309|default|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.,,
arctic_a0310|default|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.,,
arctic_a0311|default|Therefore, hurrah for the game.,,
arctic_a0312|default|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.,,,
arctic_a0313|default|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.,,,
arctic_a0314|default|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.,,,
arctic_a0315|default|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.,,
arctic_a0316|default|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.,,
arctic_a0317|default|He was a wise hyena.,,,
arctic_a0318|default|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.,,,
arctic_a0319|default|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.,,
arctic_a0320|default|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.,,,
arctic_a0321|default|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.,,,
arctic_a0322|default|This is a common experience with all of us.,,,
arctic_a0323|default|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.,,,
arctic_a0324|default|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.,,,
arctic_a0325|default|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.,,,
arctic_a0326|default|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.,,,
arctic_a0327|default|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.,,
arctic_a0328|default|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.,
arctic_a0329|default|Ah, indeed.,,
arctic_a0330|default|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.,,,
arctic_a0331|default|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.,,,
arctic_a0332|default|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.,,
arctic_a0333|default|This is no place for you.,,,
arctic_a0334|default|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.,,,
arctic_a0335|default|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.,,,
arctic_a0336|default|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.,,,
arctic_a0337|default|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.,,
arctic_a0338|default|The fighting had now become intermittent.,,,
arctic_a0339|default|They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.,,
arctic_a0340|default|It was like the beating of hoofs.,,,
arctic_a0341|default|Why, doggone you all, shake again.,
arctic_a0342|default|Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.,
arctic_a0343|default|You mean for this State, General, Alberta.,
arctic_a0344|default|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.,,,
arctic_a0345|default|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.,,,
arctic_a0346|default|Get down and dig in.,,,
arctic_a0347|default|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.,,,
arctic_a0348|default|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.,,,
arctic_a0349|default|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.,
arctic_a0350|default|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.,,,
arctic_a0351|default|It was more like sugar.,,,
arctic_a0352|default|I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.,,
arctic_a0353|default|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.,,,
arctic_a0354|default|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.,,,
arctic_a0355|default|A burst of laughter was his reward.,,,
arctic_a0356|default|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.,,,
arctic_a0357|default|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.,,
arctic_a0358|default|They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.,,
arctic_a0359|default|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.,,,
arctic_a0360|default|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.,,,
arctic_a0361|default|But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.,,
arctic_a0362|default|Nope, not the slightest idea.,,
arctic_a0363|default|It is not an attempt to smash the market.,,,
arctic_a0364|default|We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.,,
arctic_a0365|default|These rumors may even originate with us.,,,
arctic_a0366|default|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.,,,
arctic_a0367|default|There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not.,,
arctic_a0368|default|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.,,,
arctic_a0369|default|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.,,
arctic_a0370|default|He saw all men in the business game doing this.,,,
arctic_a0371|default|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.,,,
arctic_a0372|default|He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.,,
arctic_a0373|default|Points of view, new ideas, life.,
arctic_a0374|default|But life's worth more than cash, she argued.,,
arctic_a0375|default|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.,,,
arctic_a0376|default|Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.,
arctic_a0377|default|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.,,,
arctic_a0378|default|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.,,,
arctic_a0379|default|How old are you, daddy.,,
arctic_a0380|default|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.,,,
arctic_a0381|default|My name's Ferguson.,,,
arctic_a0382|default|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.,,,
arctic_a0383|default|To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.,,
arctic_a0384|default|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.,,,
arctic_a0385|default|That's what Carnegie did.,,,
arctic_a0386|default|I can't argue with you, and you know that.,,
arctic_a0387|default|Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.,
arctic_a0388|default|It was my idea to a tee.,,,
arctic_a0389|default|Mab, she said.,,
arctic_a0390|default|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.,,,
arctic_a0391|default|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.,,,
arctic_a0392|default|There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.,,
arctic_a0393|default|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.,,,
arctic_a0394|default|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.,,,
arctic_a0395|default|As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.,,
arctic_a0396|default|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.,,,
arctic_a0397|default|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.,,
arctic_a0398|default|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.,,
arctic_a0399|default|And here's another idea.,,,
arctic_a0400|default|Manuel had one besetting sin.,,,
arctic_a0401|default|The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.,,
arctic_a0402|default|Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.,,
arctic_a0403|default|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.,,,
arctic_a0404|default|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.,,,
arctic_a0405|default|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.,,,
arctic_a0406|default|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.,,,
arctic_a0407|default|Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
arctic_a0408|default|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.,,,
arctic_a0409|default|He could feel a new stir in the land.,,,
arctic_a0410|default|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.,,,
arctic_a0411|default|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.,,,
arctic_a0412|default|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.,,,
arctic_a0413|default|But I am at the end of my resources.,,,
arctic_a0414|default|Now our figuring was all right.,,,
arctic_a0415|default|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.,,,
arctic_a0416|default|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.,,,
arctic_a0417|default|It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.,,
arctic_a0418|default|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.,,,
arctic_a0419|default|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.,,,
arctic_a0420|default|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.,,,
arctic_a0421|default|By golly, the boy wins.,,
arctic_a0422|default|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.,,,
arctic_a0423|default|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.,,,
arctic_a0424|default|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.,,
arctic_a0425|default|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.,,,
arctic_a0426|default|They do not know the length of time of incubation.,,,
arctic_a0427|default|Enters now the psychology of the situation.,,,
arctic_a0428|default|It was not exactly a deportation.,,,
arctic_a0429|default|Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.,,
arctic_a0430|default|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.,,,
arctic_a0431|default|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.,,,
arctic_a0432|default|The boy at the wheel lost his head.,,,
arctic_a0433|default|To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.,,
arctic_a0434|default|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.,,,
arctic_a0435|default|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.,,,
arctic_a0436|default|But Martin smiled a superior smile.,,,
arctic_a0437|default|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.,,,
arctic_a0438|default|At sea, Monday, March 16,1908
arctic_a0439|default|At sea, Wednesday, March 18,1908
arctic_a0440|default|Yes, sir, I corrected.,
arctic_a0441|default|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.,,,
arctic_a0442|default|You live on an income which your father earned.,,,
arctic_a0443|default|He was worth nothing to the world.,,,
arctic_a0445|default|The creative joy, I murmured.,,
arctic_a0446|default|He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.,,
arctic_a0447|default|Ah, it is growing dark and darker.,,
arctic_a0448|default|I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.,,
arctic_a0449|default|A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.,
arctic_a0450|default|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.,,,
arctic_a0451|default|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.,,,
arctic_a0452|default|Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.,,
arctic_a0453|default|Eighteen hundred, he calculated.,,
arctic_a0454|default|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.,,,
arctic_a0455|default|I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.,,
arctic_a0456|default|But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.,,
arctic_a0457|default|What I saw I could not at first believe.,,,
arctic_a0458|default|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.,,,
arctic_a0459|default|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.,,,
arctic_a0460|default|I had forgotten their existence.,,,
arctic_a0461|default|Ah, we were very close together in that moment.,,
arctic_a0462|default|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.,,,
arctic_a0463|default|They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate.,,
arctic_a0464|default|Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.,,
arctic_a0465|default|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.,,,
arctic_a0466|default|Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.,,
arctic_a0467|default|And so early in the voyage, too.,,
arctic_a0468|default|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.,,,
arctic_a0469|default|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.,,,
arctic_a0470|default|He spat it out like so much venom.,,,
arctic_a0471|default|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.,,,
arctic_a0472|default|He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.,
arctic_a0473|default|The night was calm and snowy.,,,
arctic_a0474|default|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.,,,
arctic_a0475|default|His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.,,
arctic_a0476|default|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.,,,
arctic_a0477|default|Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.,
arctic_a0478|default|Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.,,
arctic_a0479|default|I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.,,
arctic_a0480|default|Tom Spink has a harpoon.,,,
arctic_a0481|default|Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.,,
arctic_a0482|default|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.,,,
arctic_a0483|default|Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.,,
arctic_a0484|default|No-sir-ee.,,,
arctic_a0485|default|Each insult added to the value of the claim.,,,
arctic_a0486|default|For the rest, he was a mere automaton.,,
arctic_a0487|default|The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.,,
arctic_a0488|default|Their love burned with increasing brightness.,,,
arctic_a0489|default|They were artists, not biologists.,,
arctic_a0490|default|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.,,,
arctic_a0491|default|And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.,,
arctic_a0492|default|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.,,,
arctic_a0493|default|The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated.,
arctic_a0494|default|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.,,,
arctic_a0495|default|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.,,,
arctic_a0496|default|And Tom King patiently endured.,,,
arctic_a0497|default|King took every advantage he knew.,,,
arctic_a0498|default|The lines were now very taut.,,,
arctic_a0499|default|And right there I saw and knew it all.,,,
arctic_a0500|default|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.,,,
arctic_a0501|default|You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.,
arctic_a0502|default|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.,,,
arctic_a0503|default|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.,,,
arctic_a0504|default|He was an athlete and a giant.,,,
arctic_a0505|default|We fished sharks on Niihau together.,,,
arctic_a0506|default|The Claudine was leaving next morning for Honolulu.,,,
arctic_a0507|default|In short, my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics.,,
arctic_a0508|default|Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity.,,,
arctic_a0509|default|Yet, in accordance with Ernest's test of truth, it worked.,
arctic_a0510|default|Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment.,,,
arctic_a0511|default|There is more behind this than a mere university ideal.,,,
arctic_a0512|default|No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants.,
arctic_a0513|default|We must give ourselves and not our money alone.,,,
arctic_a0514|default|We are consumed in our own flesh-pots.,,,
arctic_a0515|default|But here amongst ourselves let us speak out.,,,
arctic_a0516|default|Also, there was awe in their faces.,,
arctic_a0517|default|Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it.,,,
arctic_a0518|default|Illuminating oil was becoming all profit.,,,
arctic_a0519|default|Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land.,,,
arctic_a0520|default|He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem.,,,
arctic_a0521|default|Without them he could not run his empire.,,,
arctic_a0522|default|For such countries nothing remained but reorganization.,,,
arctic_a0523|default|They could not continue their method of producing surpluses.,,,
arctic_a0524|default|At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states.,,,
arctic_a0525|default|The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set its agents provocateurs to work.,,
arctic_a0527|default|The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield.,,,
arctic_a0528|default|Men who endure it, call it living death.,,
arctic_a0529|default|As I say, he had tapped the message very rapidly.,,
arctic_a0530|default|Ask him, I laughed, then turned to Pasquini.,
arctic_a0531|default|In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining.,,,
arctic_a0532|default|May drought destroy your crops.,,,
arctic_a0533|default|Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse.,,
arctic_a0534|default|But Johannes could, and did.,,
arctic_a0535|default|A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem.,,,
arctic_a0537|default|He was an enthusiast and a desert dweller.,,,
arctic_a0538|default|What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer, I have lived.,,
arctic_a0539|default|I should like to engage just for one whole life in that.,,,
arctic_a0540|default|Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean.,,
arctic_a0541|default|The Warden with a quart of champagne.,,,
arctic_a0542|default|Without a doubt, some of them have dinner engagements.,,
arctic_a0543|default|I had been born with no organic, chemical predisposition toward alcohol.,,
arctic_a0544|default|He may anticipate the day of his death.,,,
arctic_a0545|default|The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment.,,,
arctic_a0546|default|I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze.,,,
arctic_a0547|default|Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk.,,,
arctic_a0548|default|Also, churches and preachers I had never known.,,
arctic_a0549|default|Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn.,,,
arctic_a0550|default|This also became part of the daily schedule.,,,
arctic_a0551|default|All an appearance can know is mirage.,,,
arctic_a0552|default|Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly.,,
arctic_a0553|default|I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii.,,
arctic_a0554|default|Jack London, Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu.
arctic_a0555|default|Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away.,,,
arctic_a0556|default|Why, he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already.,,
arctic_a0557|default|The last refugee had passed.,,,
arctic_a0558|default|And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience.,
arctic_a0559|default|Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord.,,,
arctic_a0560|default|His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips.,,,
arctic_a0561|default|Bill lingered, contemplating his work with artistic appreciation.,,
arctic_a0562|default|What the flaming.,,,
arctic_a0563|default|Mrs McFee's jaws brought together with a snap.,,,
arctic_a0564|default|Then it is as I said, Womble announced with finality.,,
arctic_a0565|default|With them were Indians, also three other men.,,
arctic_a0566|default|Dennin's hands were released long enough for him to sign the document.,,,
arctic_a0567|default|Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet.,,
arctic_a0568|default|He was just bursting with joy, joy over what.,,
arctic_a0569|default|At Lake Linderman I had one canoe, very good Peterborough canoe.,,
arctic_a0570|default|Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia.,,,
arctic_a0571|default|He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out.,,,
arctic_a0572|default|I never saw anything like her in my life.,,,
arctic_a0573|default|There was no law on the Yukon save what they made for themselves.,,,
arctic_a0574|default|Good business man, Curly, O'Brien was saying.,
arctic_a0575|default|There weren't any missions, and he was the man to know.,,
arctic_a0576|default|And the big Persian knew of his existence before he did of hers.,,,
arctic_a0577|default|Once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms, Michael was helpless.,,
arctic_a0578|default|But we'll just postpone this.,,,
arctic_a0579|default|There was the Emma Louisa.,,,
arctic_a0580|default|This is my fifth voyage.,,,
arctic_a0581|default|It was this proposition that started the big idea in Daughtry's mind.,,,
arctic_a0582|default|Daughtry elaborated on the counting trick by bringing Cocky along.,,,
arctic_a0583|default|Enjoy it he did, but principally for Steward's sake.,,
arctic_a0584|default|I have long noted your thirst unquenchable.,,,
arctic_a0585|default|Wonder if he's a lion dog, Charles suggested.,,
arctic_a0586|default|We don't see ourselves as foolish.,,,
arctic_a0587|default|He had comparatively no advantages at first.,,,
arctic_a0588|default|He had proved it today, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions.,,
arctic_a0589|default|I was sick once -- typhoid.,,,
arctic_a0590|default|In a way he is my protege.,,,
arctic_a0591|default|We are both children together.,,,
arctic_a0592|default|It's only his indigestion I find fault with.,,,
arctic_a0593|default|She'd make a good wife for the cashier.,,,
arctic_b0001|default|Gad, do I remember it.,,
arctic_b0002|default|You got out by fighting, and I through a pretty girl.,,
arctic_b0003|default|I can see that knife now.,,,
arctic_b0004|default|When I can't see beauty in woman I want to die.,,,
arctic_b0005|default|His slim fingers closed like steel about Philip's.,,,
arctic_b0006|default|He seized Gregson by the arm and led him to the door.,,,
arctic_b0007|default|Hear the Indian dogs wailing down at Churchill.,,,
arctic_b0008|default|Burke himself had criticized it because of the smile.,,,
arctic_b0009|default|I'd say there was going to be a glorious scrap.,,,
arctic_b0010|default|He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger.,,
arctic_b0011|default|His eyes never took themselves for an instant from his companion's face.,,,
arctic_b0012|default|Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him.,,,
arctic_b0013|default|Lakes and rivers, hundreds of them, thousands of them.,
arctic_b0014|default|Whitefish, Gregson, whitefish and trout.,
arctic_b0015|default|They robbed me a few years later.,,,
arctic_b0016|default|He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it.,,,
arctic_b0017|default|Everything was working smoothly, better than I had expected.,,
arctic_b0018|default|I was completely lost in my work.,,,
arctic_b0019|default|His slim hands gripped the edges of the table.,,,
arctic_b0020|default|He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore to continue.,,,
arctic_b0021|default|Philip dropped back into his chair.,,,
arctic_b0022|default|If I was out of the game it would be easily made.,,,
arctic_b0023|default|MacDougall, my engineer, believes it.,
arctic_b0024|default|It is growing, every day, every hour.,
arctic_b0025|default|Now, you understand.,,
arctic_b0026|default|You have associated with some of these men.,,,
arctic_b0027|default|And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight.,,
arctic_b0028|default|Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the whole situation.,,,
arctic_b0029|default|All operations have been carried on from Montreal and Toronto.,,,
arctic_b0030|default|Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips.,,,
arctic_b0031|default|Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a pencil.,,,
arctic_b0032|default|He caught himself with a jerk.,,,
arctic_b0033|default|How does your wager look now.,,,
arctic_b0034|default|He confessed that the sketch had startled him.,,,
arctic_b0035|default|After all, the picture was only a resemblance.,,
arctic_b0036|default|He wondered, too, where Roscoe was.,
arctic_b0037|default|Philip knew that she was not an Indian.,,,
arctic_b0038|default|In her haste to get away she had forgotten these things.,,,
arctic_b0039|default|Philip took a step toward Gregson, half determined to awaken him.,,
arctic_b0040|default|The thought set his blood tingling.,,,
arctic_b0041|default|But if Pierre did not return, until tomorrow.,,
arctic_b0042|default|Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief.,,,
arctic_b0043|default|It won't be for sale.,,,
arctic_b0044|default|For a few moments he ate in silence.,,,
arctic_b0045|default|Philip did not pursue the subject.,,,
arctic_b0046|default|Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him.,,,
arctic_b0047|default|Suppose you saw me at work through the window.,,,
arctic_b0048|default|He looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two.,,,
arctic_b0049|default|There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words.,,
arctic_b0050|default|All this day Gregson remained in the cabin.,,,
arctic_b0051|default|The sixth day he spent in the cabin with Gregson.,,,
arctic_b0052|default|The flush was gone from her face.,,,
arctic_b0053|default|That is why I am, am rattled, he laughed.,
arctic_b0054|default|He understood the meaning of the look.,,,
arctic_b0055|default|She was even more beautiful than when I saw her, before.,,
arctic_b0056|default|I'll give a thousand if you produce her, retorted Gregson.,,
arctic_b0057|default|They have won popular sentiment through the newspapers.,,,
arctic_b0058|default|We must achieve our own salvation.,,,
arctic_b0059|default|In moments of mental energy Philip was restless.,,,
arctic_b0060|default|He would keep his faith with Gregson for the promised day or two.,,,
arctic_b0061|default|Something about it seemed to fascinate him, to challenge his presence.,,
arctic_b0062|default|Now it was missing from the wall.,,,
arctic_b0063|default|He boiled himself some coffee and sat down to wait.,,,
arctic_b0064|default|I'm going down there with you, and I'm going to fight.,,
arctic_b0065|default|Now have you got anything to say against me, Mr Philip.,,
arctic_b0066|default|If I meet her again I shall apologize, said Eileen.,,
arctic_b0067|default|Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling starlight.,,,
arctic_b0068|default|Only the chance sound had led him to observe them.,,,
arctic_b0069|default|Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre.,,,
arctic_b0070|default|There was no chance to fire without hitting him.,,,
arctic_b0071|default|There was no answer from the other side.,,,
arctic_b0072|default|Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him.,,
arctic_b0073|default|With these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone.,,,
arctic_b0074|default|Yet, behind them there was another and more powerful motive.,,
arctic_b0075|default|In that case he could not miss them, if he used caution.,,
arctic_b0076|default|Before Philip could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards were upon him.,,,
arctic_b0077|default|It is the nearest refuge.,,,
arctic_b0078|default|There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice.,,
arctic_b0079|default|The truth of it set Jeanne quivering.,,,
arctic_b0080|default|Tomorrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon.,,,
arctic_b0081|default|You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock.,,,
arctic_b0082|default|He bit his tongue, and cursed himself at this fresh break.,,
arctic_b0083|default|In it there was something that was almost tragedy.,,,
arctic_b0084|default|Your face is red with blood.,,,
arctic_b0085|default|Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank.,,,
arctic_b0086|default|He can care for himself.,,,
arctic_b0087|default|They will search for us between their camp and Churchill.,,,
arctic_b0088|default|Until I die, he exclaimed.,,
arctic_b0089|default|Her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils.,,,
arctic_b0090|default|The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed.,,,
arctic_b0091|default|For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking.,,,
arctic_b0092|default|I want to die in it.,,,
arctic_b0093|default|Darkness hid him from Jeanne.,,,
arctic_b0094|default|And yet if she came he had no words to say.,,,
arctic_b0095|default|He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day.,,,
arctic_b0096|default|Within himself he called it no longer his own.,,,
arctic_b0097|default|Besides, that noise makes me deaf.,,
arctic_b0098|default|Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe.,,,
arctic_b0099|default|Fifty yards ahead of her were the first of the rocks.,,,
arctic_b0100|default|There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne.,
arctic_b0101|default|You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win.,,
arctic_b0102|default|I'll only be in the way.,,,
arctic_b0103|default|He lifted his eyes, and a strange cry burst from his lips.,,
arctic_b0104|default|Shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body.,,,
arctic_b0105|default|I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows.,,
arctic_b0106|default|For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face.,,,
arctic_b0107|default|He was sure, now, of but few things.,
arctic_b0108|default|It was a miracle, and I owe you my life.,,
arctic_b0109|default|Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him.,,,
arctic_b0110|default|Such men believe, when they come together.,,
arctic_b0111|default|The journey was continued at dawn.,,,
arctic_b0112|default|Jeanne and Pierre both gazed toward the great rock.,,,
arctic_b0113|default|There was something pathetic in the girl's attitude now.,,,
arctic_b0114|default|He moved his position, and the illusion was gone.,,
arctic_b0115|default|For two hours not a word passed between them.,,,
arctic_b0116|default|I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip.,,
arctic_b0117|default|That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer.,,
arctic_b0118|default|We saw your light, and thought you wouldn't mind a call.,,
arctic_b0119|default|Billinger may arrive in time.,,,
arctic_b0120|default|There's the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette.,
arctic_b0121|default|I want my men to work by themselves.,,,
arctic_b0122|default|Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe.,,,
arctic_b0123|default|Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpe's men.,,,
arctic_b0124|default|Two weeks passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times.,,
arctic_b0125|default|It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear.,,,
arctic_b0126|default|Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast.,,,
arctic_b0127|default|He destroyed everything that had belonged to the woman.,,,
arctic_b0128|default|Philip bent low over Pierre.,,,
arctic_b0129|default|Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill.,,,
arctic_b0130|default|She saw the answer in his face.,,,
arctic_b0131|default|Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you.,,
arctic_b0132|default|There is no need of further detail, now -- for you can understand.,,
arctic_b0133|default|There followed a roar that shook the earth.,,,
arctic_b0134|default|Blind with rage, he darted in.,,
arctic_b0135|default|In it was the joy of life.,,,
arctic_b0136|default|Swiftly his eyes measured the situation.,,,
arctic_b0137|default|But this little defect did not worry him.,,,
arctic_b0138|default|And then, steadily, he began to chew.,
arctic_b0139|default|Together they ate the rabbit.,,,
arctic_b0140|default|They edged nearer, and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world.,,
arctic_b0141|default|It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits.,,,
arctic_b0142|default|Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now.,,,
arctic_b0143|default|It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it.,,,
arctic_b0144|default|But there was no longer the mother yearning in his heart.,,,
arctic_b0145|default|Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest.,,
arctic_b0146|default|After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment.,,
arctic_b0147|default|Had it struck squarely it would have killed him.,,,
arctic_b0148|default|The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce.,,,
arctic_b0149|default|Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur.,,,
arctic_b0150|default|And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear.,,,
arctic_b0151|default|It was steel, a fisher trap.,,
arctic_b0152|default|OW, a wild dog, he growled.,
arctic_b0153|default|He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home.,,,
arctic_b0154|default|That is the strange part of it.,,,
arctic_b0155|default|His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor.,,,
arctic_b0156|default|For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight.,,,
arctic_b0157|default|In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle.,,,
arctic_b0158|default|She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms.,,
arctic_b0159|default|His teeth shut with a last click.,,,
arctic_b0160|default|It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators.,,,
arctic_b0161|default|In a flash he was on his feet, facing him.,,
arctic_b0162|default|He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders.,,,
arctic_b0163|default|The moon had already begun its westward decline.,,,
arctic_b0164|default|They laughed like two happy children.,,,
arctic_b0165|default|He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back.,,
arctic_b0166|default|Fast, but endure.,,
arctic_b0167|default|A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came.,,
arctic_b0168|default|The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart.,,,
arctic_b0169|default|He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them.,,,
arctic_b0170|default|Then he shouted, Shut up.,,
arctic_b0171|default|He changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair.,,,
arctic_b0172|default|On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded.,,,
arctic_b0173|default|To these he gave castor oil.,,,
arctic_b0174|default|Hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing.,,,
arctic_b0175|default|Sheldon glanced at the thermometer.,,,
arctic_b0176|default|I'll see to poor Hughie.,,,
arctic_b0177|default|Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering.,,
arctic_b0178|default|Also, I want information.,,
arctic_b0179|default|Let them go out and eat with my boys.,,,
arctic_b0180|default|I, I beg pardon, he drawled.,
arctic_b0181|default|And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge belt.,,,
arctic_b0182|default|I was in New York when the crash came.,,,
arctic_b0183|default|No, I did not fall among thieves.,,
arctic_b0184|default|Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips.,,,
arctic_b0185|default|Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me.,,,
arctic_b0186|default|I can't go elsewhere, by your own account.,,
arctic_b0187|default|Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation.,,,
arctic_b0188|default|He glanced down at her helplessly, and moistened his lips.,,
arctic_b0189|default|That is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals.,,,
arctic_b0190|default|Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off.,,
arctic_b0191|default|He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons.,,,
arctic_b0192|default|Outsiders are allowed five minute speeches, the sick man urged.,,
arctic_b0193|default|So was Packard's finish suicide.,,,
arctic_b0194|default|Joan cried, with shining eyes.,,
arctic_b0195|default|Nobody knows how the natives got them.,,,
arctic_b0196|default|How can you manage all alone, Mr Young.,,
arctic_b0197|default|The planters are already considering the matter.,,,
arctic_b0198|default|I use great trouble advisedly.,,,
arctic_b0199|default|Dear Sir, Your second victim has fallen on schedule time.,,
arctic_b0200|default|We leave the eventuality to time and law.,,,
arctic_b0201|default|I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe.,,,
arctic_b0202|default|Society is shaken to its foundations.,,,
arctic_b0203|default|A month in Australia would finish me.,,,
arctic_b0204|default|Down through the perfume weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods.,,,
arctic_b0205|default|You were destroying my life.,,,
arctic_b0206|default|Horses and rifles had been her toys, camp and trail her nursery.,,
arctic_b0207|default|I'm as good as a man, she urged.,,
arctic_b0208|default|You read the quotations in today's paper.,,,
arctic_b0209|default|He's terribly touchy about his black wards, as he calls them.,,
arctic_b0210|default|Whatever he guessed he locked away in the taboo room of Naomi.,,,
arctic_b0211|default|This is eighteen eighty.,,,
arctic_b0212|default|Death is and has been ever since old Maui died.,,,
arctic_b0213|default|Some boy, she laughed acquiescence.,,
arctic_b0214|default|Let us talk it over and find a way out.,,,
arctic_b0215|default|It is a good property, and worth more than that.,,
arctic_b0216|default|I wish you were more adaptable, Joan retorted.,,
arctic_b0217|default|Such is my passage engaged on the steamer.,,,
arctic_b0218|default|The issue was not in doubt.,,,
arctic_b0219|default|Well, there are better men in Hawaii, that's all.,
arctic_b0220|default|Harry Bancroft, Dave lied.,,
arctic_b0221|default|It's a Yankee, Joan cried.,,
arctic_b0222|default|He was the leader, and Tudor was his lieutenant.,,
arctic_b0223|default|They likewise are disinclined to being eaten.,,,
arctic_b0224|default|But to culture the Revolution thus far had exhausted the Junta.,,,
arctic_b0225|default|The President of the United States was his friend.,,,
arctic_b0226|default|Your face was the personification of duplicity.,,,
arctic_b0227|default|Shorty turned to their employers.,,,
arctic_b0228|default|You were engaged.,,,
arctic_b0229|default|I saw it all myself, and it was splendid.,,
arctic_b0230|default|Now run along, and tell them to hurry.,,
arctic_b0231|default|What's that grub-thief got to do with it.,,,
arctic_b0232|default|It was a superb picture.,,,
arctic_b0233|default|So she said, the irate skipper dashed on.,,
arctic_b0234|default|And watch out for wet feet, was his parting advice.,,
arctic_b0235|default|Raoul yelled, in order to make himself heard.,,
arctic_b0236|default|Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land.,,,
arctic_b0237|default|They just lay off in the bush and plugged away.,,,
arctic_b0238|default|The very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating.,,,
arctic_b0239|default|And there was a dog that barked.,,,
arctic_b0240|default|There are four, all low, McCoy answered.,
arctic_b0241|default|The women they carried away with them to the Big Valley.,,,
arctic_b0242|default|The Japanese understood as we could never school ourselves or hope to understand.,,,
arctic_b0243|default|They had been on the same lay as ourselves.,,,
arctic_b0244|default|You are positively soulless, he said savagely.,,
arctic_b0245|default|Harrison is still my chauffeur.,,,
arctic_b0246|default|The boy grew and prospered.,,,
arctic_b0247|default|He wanted to give the finish to this foe already so far gone.,,,
arctic_b0248|default|Exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol.,,,
arctic_b0249|default|I know they are my oysters.,,,
arctic_b0250|default|By this time Charley was as enraged as the Greek.,,,
arctic_b0251|default|They must have been swept away by the chaotic currents.,,,
arctic_b0252|default|It resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne.,,,
arctic_b0253|default|The very opposite is true; they are discouraged vagabonds.,,,
arctic_b0254|default|At the same time spears and arrows began to fall among the invaders.,,,
arctic_b0255|default|Then, again, Tudor had such an irritating way about him.,
arctic_b0256|default|Outwardly, he maintained a calm and smiling aspect.,,
arctic_b0257|default|Tudor surveyed him with withering disgust.,,,
arctic_b0258|default|You fired me out of your house, in short.,,
arctic_b0259|default|Her mouth opened, but instead of speaking she drew a long sigh.,,
arctic_b0260|default|It's worth eight dollars.,,,
arctic_b0261|default|And he did hurt my arm.,,,
arctic_b0262|default|Saxon's onto her job.,,,
arctic_b0263|default|Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another.,,,
arctic_b0264|default|But this time it was Saxon who rebelled.,,,
arctic_b0265|default|I was not to cry out in the face of fear.,,,
arctic_b0266|default|And now put yourself in my place for a moment.,,,
arctic_b0267|default|The boy threw back his head with pride.,,,
arctic_b0268|default|Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned.,,
arctic_b0269|default|Why not like any railroad station or ferry depot.,,,
arctic_b0270|default|We could throw stones with our feet.,,,
arctic_b0271|default|It was put together in a casual, helter-skelter sort of way.,,
arctic_b0272|default|These were merely stout sticks an inch or so in diameter.,,,
arctic_b0273|default|Then it was that a strange thing happened.,,,
arctic_b0274|default|From the source of light a harsh voice said.,,,
arctic_b0275|default|But I did not enjoy it long.,,,
arctic_b0276|default|We were now good friends.,,,
arctic_b0277|default|Two of the Folk were already up.,,,
arctic_b0278|default|Now animals do not like mockery.,,,
arctic_b0279|default|He gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees.,,,
arctic_b0280|default|Again the girls applauded, and Mrs Hall cried.,,
arctic_b0281|default|Just the same I'd sooner be myself than have book indigestion.,,,
arctic_b0282|default|Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured.,,,
arctic_b0283|default|But we were without this momentum.,,,
arctic_b0284|default|There was one difficulty, however.,,
arctic_b0285|default|The hyena proceeded to dine.,,,
arctic_b0286|default|The time was considered auspicious.,,,
arctic_b0287|default|Or have they already devised one.,,,
arctic_b0288|default|We would not spend another such night.,,,
arctic_b0289|default|At first his progress was slow and erratic.,,,
arctic_b0290|default|He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated.,,
arctic_b0291|default|The awe of man rushed over him again.,,,
arctic_b0292|default|The Fire-Men wore animal skins around their waists and across their shoulders.,,,
arctic_b0293|default|Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities.,,,
arctic_b0294|default|For a much longer time Lop-Ear and I remained and watched.,,,
arctic_b0295|default|All right, Sir, replied Jock with great regret.,
arctic_b0296|default|At times I wondered where Sir Archibald got his style.,,,
arctic_b0297|default|Why should a fellow throw up the sponge after the first round.,,,
arctic_b0298|default|His hand shot out and clutched Crooked-Leg by the neck.,,,
arctic_b0299|default|Miss Brodie's smile was slightly sarcastic.,,,
arctic_b0300|default|Does the old boy often go off at half-cock that way.,,,
arctic_b0301|default|A flying arrow passed between us.,,,
arctic_b0302|default|I pulled, suddenly, with all my might.,
arctic_b0303|default|Here we allow our solicitors to look after our legal work.,,,
arctic_b0304|default|His previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children.,,,
arctic_b0305|default|It was our river emerging like ourselves from the great swamp.,,,
arctic_b0306|default|Cameron looked at his hands with their long, sinewy fingers.,,
arctic_b0307|default|We got few vegetables and fruits, and became fish eaters.,,
arctic_b0308|default|We never made another migration.,,,
arctic_b0309|default|Nor was Elam Harnish an exception.,,,
arctic_b0310|default|A little treatment, massage, with some help from the doctor.,
arctic_b0311|default|The 29th very foggy.,,,
arctic_b0312|default|Dig in; you're sure good, was Daylight's answer.,,
arctic_b0313|default|The apron string loomed near and he shied like an unbroken colt.,,,
arctic_b0314|default|He had been born with this endowment.,,,
arctic_b0315|default|And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal.,,,
arctic_b0316|default|Though the aurora still flamed, another day had begun.,,
arctic_b0317|default|He did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury.,,,
arctic_b0318|default|Again he had done the big thing.,,,
arctic_b0319|default|Daylight was tired, profoundly tired.,,
arctic_b0320|default|The regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter.,,,
arctic_b0321|default|Instead, he arrived on the night of the second day.,,
arctic_b0322|default|Their supply of grub was gone.,,,
arctic_b0323|default|Crickets began to chirp, and more geese and ducks flew overhead.,,
arctic_b0324|default|Not till the twentieth of May did the river break.,,,
arctic_b0325|default|It was a gigantic inadequacy.,,,
arctic_b0326|default|Our Mr Howison will call upon you at your hotel.,,,
arctic_b0327|default|He had been so easy.,,,
arctic_b0328|default|Change chairs, Daylight commanded.,,
arctic_b0329|default|I'd sooner have my chips back.,,,
arctic_b0330|default|They only had a little thirty thousand dollar fire.,,,
arctic_b0331|default|His partners had starved and died on the Stewart.,,,
arctic_b0332|default|As to how she dressed, he had no ideas at all.,,
arctic_b0333|default|It does, was her audacious answer.,,
arctic_b0334|default|Oh, it's just a novel, a love story.,
arctic_b0335|default|Whoever lived on the ranch did that.,,,
arctic_b0336|default|How old are you, mother.,,
arctic_b0337|default|Here he got a fresh thrill.,,,
arctic_b0338|default|It was unobtrusive, yet it was there.,,
arctic_b0339|default|Well, I'll be plumb gosh darned.,,
arctic_b0340|default|These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him.,,,
arctic_b0341|default|I play that choice wide open to win.,,,
arctic_b0342|default|Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up.,,,
arctic_b0343|default|But how are you going to do it.,,,
arctic_b0344|default|Lots of men take women buggy riding.,,,
arctic_b0345|default|Daylight made no answer, and the door closed behind him.,,
arctic_b0346|default|There's not an iota of truth in it.,,,
arctic_b0347|default|But ever his gaze returned to that Crouched Venus on the piano.,,,
arctic_b0348|default|Would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me.,,,
arctic_b0349|default|In such a tumbling of values was no time to sell.,,,
arctic_b0350|default|Stand off butcher and baker and all the rest.,,,
arctic_b0351|default|Matthewson, who's this bookkeeper, Rogers.,
arctic_b0352|default|Now just what do you want to know.,,,
arctic_b0353|default|I want to know how all this is possible.,,,
arctic_b0354|default|It's that much junk.,,,
arctic_b0355|default|There was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed.,,,
arctic_b0356|default|He loved to play Chinese lottery.,,,
arctic_b0357|default|The Law of Club and Fang,,,
arctic_b0358|default|The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip.,,,
arctic_b0359|default|And as never before, he was ready to obey.,,
arctic_b0360|default|This state of mind comes of an undue prominence of the ego.,,,
arctic_b0361|default|There are the canals of China, and the Yang-tse River.,,
arctic_b0362|default|We threaten to be of the one mind before the voyage is completed.,,,
arctic_b0363|default|She was built primarily to sail.,,,
arctic_b0364|default|In the Bohemian Club of San Francisco there are some crack sailors.,,,
arctic_b0365|default|My age, in years, is twenty two.,
arctic_b0366|default|I forgot how easily I had taught myself from the printed page.,,,
arctic_b0367|default|Any average young fellow can teach himself in a week.,,,
arctic_b0368|default|Please do not think that I already know it all.,,,
arctic_b0369|default|You see, we were teaching ourselves.,,
arctic_b0370|default|And now behold the perversity of things.,,,
arctic_b0371|default|Yield yourself to the waters that are ripping and tearing at you.,,,
arctic_b0372|default|Mr McVeigh told me about him.,,,
arctic_b0373|default|Unlike Joshua, he stood in no need of divine assistance.,,
arctic_b0374|default|To say the least, Captain Cook was a rather thorough going empiricist.,,
arctic_b0375|default|Man could not conquer them.,,,
arctic_b0376|default|Thought I, and a worthy fool he proved.,,
arctic_b0377|default|A scarlet loincloth completed his costume.,,,
arctic_b0378|default|I like to speculate upon the glorious future of man.,,,
arctic_b0379|default|Christmas is an easy problem compared with a Polynesian giving-feast.,,,
arctic_b0380|default|He had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it.,,,
arctic_b0381|default|And how would we ever find ourselves.,,,
arctic_b0382|default|I defy any man to get a Solomon Island sore in California.,,,
arctic_b0383|default|A bush chief had died a natural death.,,,
arctic_b0384|default|The skipper's and Nakata's gymnastics served as a translation without words.,,,
arctic_b0385|default|Last night he showed all the symptoms of coming down with pneumonia.,,,
arctic_b0386|default|My idea was that he would have more influence over the natives.,,,
arctic_b0387|default|It is merely the simple superlative.,,,
arctic_b0388|default|I made no more overtures.,,,
arctic_b0389|default|Among my minor afflictions, I may mention a new and mysterious one.,,
arctic_b0390|default|The voyage was our idea of a good time.,,,
arctic_b0391|default|At sea, Tuesday, March 17,1908
arctic_b0392|default|Yes, sir, he answered, with cheerful alacrity.
arctic_b0393|default|I was still weak from my prolonged immersion.,,,
arctic_b0394|default|The boy hesitated, then mastered his temper.,,
arctic_b0395|default|I was beneath the water, suffocating and drowning.,,
arctic_b0396|default|The pain from my hurt knee was agonizing.,,,
arctic_b0397|default|The hunters were still arguing and roaring like some semi-human amphibious breed.,,,
arctic_b0398|default|I have been robbed, sir, I amended.,
arctic_b0399|default|You were looking squeamish this afternoon, he began.,,
arctic_b0400|default|How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment.,,,
arctic_b0401|default|I learned it myself in English ships.,,,
arctic_b0402|default|An altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others.,,,
arctic_b0403|default|Knowing him, I review the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding.,,
arctic_b0404|default|Yes, and no, sir, was the slow reply.
arctic_b0405|default|And each year something happened, and I did not go.,,
arctic_b0406|default|How in hell did he know it was you in the dark.,,,
arctic_b0407|default|Of course much grumbling went on, and little outbursts were continually occurring.,,
arctic_b0408|default|You have all the advantage.,,,
arctic_b0409|default|The dirk mentioned by Wolf Larsen rested in its sheath on my hip.,,,
arctic_b0410|default|Have you ever earned a dollar by your own labour.,,,
arctic_b0411|default|He gave no reason, but his motive was obvious enough.,,
arctic_b0412|default|Ah, it was sweet in my ears.,,
arctic_b0413|default|He may desire to escape pain, or to enjoy pleasure.,,
arctic_b0414|default|It was impossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore.,,,
arctic_b0415|default|There was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean.,,,
arctic_b0416|default|I arose obediently and went down the beach.,,,
arctic_b0417|default|The next thing to watch out for is bed sores.,,,
arctic_b0418|default|At that moment I got the impression that she was willowy.,,,
arctic_b0419|default|Your father's fifth command, he nodded.,,
arctic_b0420|default|On occasion, on this traverse, the Cape Verde Islands are raised.,
arctic_b0421|default|She is essentially the life-giving, life-conserving female of the species.,,
arctic_b0422|default|This was when the explosion occurred.,,,
arctic_b0423|default|Also, at regular intervals, he would mutter.,
arctic_b0424|default|It is a very tenable hypothesis, and will bear looking into.,,
arctic_b0425|default|There were orange-green, gold-green, and a copper-green.,
arctic_b0426|default|The Gabriel voice of the Samurai rang out.,,,
arctic_b0427|default|The sunsets grow more bizarre and spectacular off this coast of the Argentine.,,,
arctic_b0428|default|The history of our westward-faring race is written in it.,,,
arctic_b0429|default|And the Eurasian Chinese-Englishman bowed himself away.,,,
arctic_b0430|default|They were babbling and chattering all together.,,,
arctic_b0431|default|Too much, he told me, with ominous rolling head.,
